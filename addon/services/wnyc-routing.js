/*
   Ember doesn't expose a public router service yet, but it will soon,
   and it's really convenient to have in a component-centric
   world. This encapsulates some use of private API to give us the
   benefits now, with an easy upgrade path to the future solution.

    handlers.forEach(h => {
      // Originally the parameters were stripped down to just one param.
      // Added all params for the schedule-date route and it appears to not break anything
